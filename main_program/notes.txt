**Black Holes**

**Definition:**
A region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.

**Formation:**
A black hole is formed when:

â€¢ A very massive star runs out of fuel
â€¢ The star collapses under its own gravity

**Structure:**
At the center of a black hole lies the **singularity**, where:
â€¢ Mass is concentrated
â€¢ Density becomes extremely high

**Surrounding Area:**
The singularity is surrounded by the **event horizon**, which marks the boundary beyond which nothing, including light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.
