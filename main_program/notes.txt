**Black Holes**

**Definition:**
A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape once it falls within a certain distance.

**Key Characteristics:**

â€¢ **Incredible Gravity:** Black holes have an extremely strong gravitational force due to their massive density.
â€¢ **No Escape:** Not even light can escape from a black hole once it crosses a certain boundary called the event horizon.
â€¢ **Event Horizon:** The point of no return, where the gravitational pull is so strong that anything crossing it will be trapped by the black hole.

**Note:** Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity. They continue to attract matter and energy until they become incredibly dense, creating an intense gravitational field.
